# Neki - A Cross-Platform Vulkan/PS5 Render Engine
![Logo](.github/logo.png)

Neki is an in-development cross-platform render engine built for Vulkan (x64/Linux) and AGC (PS5).

This engine primarily serves as a personal learning project of mine in an effort to develop a deep understanding for modern graphics APIs and professional software architecture. In this sense, it's built to prioritise clarity and flexibility over enforcing a rigid structure.

AGC code unavailable due to Sony's NDA.
